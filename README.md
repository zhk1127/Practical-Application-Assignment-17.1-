Practical Application Assignment 17.1: Comparing Classifiers

Data: The dataset you will use comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository Links to an external site (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing). The data is from a Portuguese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. You can make use of the article Links to an external site.accompanying the dataset (A data-driven approach to predict the success of bank telemarketing
By SÃ©rgio Moro, P. Cortez, P. Rita. 2014) for more information on the data and features.

Key findings summary:  

1 Decision tree model works best for the imbalanced dataset; Decision Tree model can give rise to best recall score and also it works relatively fast.

2 SVM model works really slow for such a large dataset; it may be important to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using PCA to increase the speed.

3 Knn model works fast and performs well.

4 Including more features particularly these numerical features in the model can increase the overall accuracy.

5. Based on logistic regression model with L1 regularizaiton, the most predictive features include duration, emp.var.rate, cons.price.idx, euribor3m, poutcome_failure.
